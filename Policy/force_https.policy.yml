title: "Cloudflare always use HTTPS"
class: \Drutiny\Cloudflare\Audit\PageRuleMatch
name: cloudflare:always_use_https
description: |
  To ensure all traffic to {{host}} is secured over an SSL connection, Cloudflare
  comes with a feature to force any insecure traffic to redirect to a secure
  connection before a connection to the origin location is attempted. This ensures
  all traffic to {{host}} is secured between the browser and Cloudflare.
remediation: |
  Add a page rule in Cloudflare with the matching pattern of `{{rule}}`.

  For this rule, ensure the Always use HTTPS setting is enabled. Ensure this
  rule is placed before any other rules that match the {{zone}} domain.
success: "Always use HTTPS is enabled for the rule `{{rule}}`."
failure: Always use HTTPS is not enabled for the rule `{{rule}}`.
parameters:
  rule:
    default: http://:host/*
  settings:
    default:
      always_use_https: true
