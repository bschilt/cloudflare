title: "#2819197 - Cloudflare workaround for Drupal 8 urlGenerator"
class: \Drutiny\Cloudflare\Audit\PageRuleMatch
name: cloudflare:drupal-urlGenerator-workaround
description: |
  By accessing a site an an unexpected base path (e.g. with index.php) a site may
  cache links in a way that could be considered a minor site defacement and
  possibly lead to a duplicate content SEO penalty too. It can also impact
  caching strategy.
remediation: |
  Add a page rule in Cloudflare with the matching pattern of `{{rule}}`.

  For this rule, ensure a Forwarding URL setting is selected and forwards to
  `{{settings.forwarding_url.url}}` with a status code of `{{settings.forwarding_url.status_code}}`
success: |
  There is a page rule for {{rule}} which forwards to {{settings.forwarding_url.url}}
  with a status code of {{settings.forwarding_url.status_code}}.
failure: No forwarding for {{rule}} has been setup.
parameters:
  rule:
    default: https://:host/index.php/*
  settings:
    default:
      forwarding_url:
        url: https://:host/$1
        status_code: 301
