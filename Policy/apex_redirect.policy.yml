title: "Cloudflare redirect Apex to primary domain"
class: \Drutiny\Cloudflare\Audit\PageRuleMatch
name: cloudflare:redirect_apex
description: |
  If {{host}} is the primary site under the {{zone}} domain then you may want all
  traffic to https://{{zone}}/ to be redirected to https://{{host}}/. This ensures
  all traffic to both {{host}} and {{zone}} are routed through a common domain
  and makes management of Cloudflare Page Rules easier to administer. This reduces
  the likelihood of strange behaviour due to Page Rules.
remediation: |
  Add a page rule in Cloudflare with the matching pattern of `{{rule}}`.

  For this rule, ensure a Forwarding URL setting is selected and forwards to
  `{{settings.forwarding_url.url}}` with a status code of *{{settings.forwarding_url.status_code}}*
success: |
  There is a page rule for {{rule}} which forwards to {{settings.forwarding_url.url}}
  with a status code of {{settings.forwarding_url.status_code}}.
failure: |
  {{#actions.forwarding_url}}
    A Forwarding URL was found but incorrect. URL forwarded to
    {{actions.forwarding_url.url}} with a status code of
    {{actions.forwarding_url.status_code}}.
  {{/actions.forwarding_url}}
  {{^actions.forwarding_url}}
    No such rule was found with an existing Forwarding URL.
  {{/actions.forwarding_url}}

  rule:
    default: https://:zone/*
